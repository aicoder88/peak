# Subpage Aesthetic Enhancements

I have enhanced the aesthetics of the subpages to match the "masculine, scientific, modern, powerful" theme.

## Changes Made

### 1. Weight Management Page (`/weight-management`)
- **Hero Section**: Added a powerful hero image (`weight-hero.png`) with a dark overlay and dramatic typography.
- **Styling**: Implemented glassmorphism for cards, added a "science abstract" background element, and improved the layout of the "How It Works" and "Benefits" sections.
- **Visuals**: Added `science-abstract.png` as a subtle background decoration.

### 2. FAQ Page (`/faq`)
- **Hero Section**: Added a clean, modern hero image (`faq-hero.png`).
- **Accordion**: Updated the accordion styling to be more modern with better spacing and hover effects.

### 3. About Us Page (`/about`)
- **Hero Section**: Added a high-end clinic interior image (`about-hero.png`).
- **Leadership Team**: Improved the layout of the leadership team section, making the profile images larger and the text more readable.
- **Mission Section**: Added the `science-abstract.png` image to the mission section to add visual interest.
